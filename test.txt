Once upon a time, a clumsy penguin named Percy decided to take up ice skating, despite having two left feet, or rather, two left flippers. 
On his first day at the rink, he slipped and slid in every direction, unintentionally joining a synchronized skating team's performance, earning him a standing ovation from the audience. 
Determined to improve, he practiced diligently but ended up crashing into the ice machine, causing an avalanche of snow cones that buried the entire snack bar.
Percy eventually became a beloved mascot for the rink, donning a sparkly costume with flippers that alternated left and right, forever embracing his penguin-sonality on the ice.
The end.
